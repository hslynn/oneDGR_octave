# An octave(matlab) program to solve Einstein Field Equations in 1 dimension (spherical reduction)

Working parameter: 
* inB = 1.5, outB = 2.5, meshNum = 1;
* N = 10, eta = 0.3, s = 14;

Still not working: 
* outB = 5;

Conjecture:
* The instability are because of two things:
    1. Aliasing
    2. Something else
